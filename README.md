# StartPage-for-Playnite

Extension for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) that adds a configurable start page.

The layout can be customized by splitting and merging panels in a grid when in Edit Mode (can be opened by left-clicking the background).
Each panel can have a view attached to it and views can be swapped in Edit Mode via drag-and-drop.
